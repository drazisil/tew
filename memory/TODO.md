# TODO

Durable follow-up work, checked/updated as picked up. Distinct from status.md
(current session's active blocker) and changelog.md (completed work) --
items here are queued but not yet started, or started and paused.

## NEW (2026-08-29): a scheduler mock/test helper is worth building at some point

Noted by Molly: real async coverage (queues, packet handling) is coming up,
and testing that against the full `ZigScheduler` (as `test_invoke_emulated_proc_thread_death.py`
and friends do today) is heavier than most tests need. A lightweight mock
scheduler double, usable wherever a test only needs to control
`current_idx`/thread status without a real cooperative scheduler, would
make that work easier to test in isolation. Not started -- no immediate
blocker yet, just flagged before the queue/packet work begins.

## RESOLVED (2026-08-29, cont'd x40): DAO/Jet query-parameter gap -- `StockAssembly_SelectAPT` "could not get param count" -- FULLY FIXED end to end

Full root cause and fix in status.md "cont'd x40" and changelog.md's
matching entry. x39 fixed `GetLocaleInfoW` and a cascade of exposed
locale/calendar table gaps (`_wtoi`, `_itoa`, a mislabeled
`LOCALE_SMONTHNAME1..13` entry, `GetCalendarInfoW`, `NlsGetCacheUpdateCount`,
a silent-stub logging gap in `MultiByteToWideChar`/`WideCharToMultiByte`).
With those closed, `VarDateFromStr` still failed -- traced to
`classify_wide_string` (`char_type.py`) leaving its output buffer
unwritten when asked to classify a null-terminated "string" whose first
character IS the terminator (a zero-length classification), which let a
caller read back stale leftover data (a `DIGIT` flag from the character
tested just before) and made a date-string tokenizer wrongly treat two
null bytes as still-a-digit, overshooting the true end of a number by 2
WCHARs. Fixed by always writing a real classification for the terminator
in that case. Confirmed live end-to-end: `StockAssembly_SelectAPT`'s error
no longer appears anywhere in `stdout.txt`; the game runs straight past
the whole query.

**New, completely unrelated blocker opened immediately downstream**: an
unhandled SEH fault at `EIP=0x1901d9eb` (0x19xxxxxx range -- a different
DLL entirely). Not yet investigated at all -- pick this up first next
session.

## RESOLVED (2026-08-29, cont'd x40): `FUN_77121505` "thread splat" suspicion -- ruled out, real cause was the already-documented `THREAD_SENTINEL` collision

Reran with `thread` added to `LOG_CATEGORIES` per the plan from x39;
`FUN_77121505` never fires at all in the relevant window. What DOES fire
early in every run is the already-documented (see the `THREAD_SENTINEL`
entry below, "NEW (2026-08-26)") spurious "thread died" event from
`OLEAUT32.dll`'s real `DllMain` static initializer sharing `THREAD_SENTINEL`
with real thread completion -- non-fatal, `_invoke_emulated_proc` catches
it and continues normally. This is almost certainly what Molly's original
"thread went splat" recollection actually was. `FUN_77121505` itself is
confirmed, separately and conclusively, to be a correct, real stack-cookie
check (`__chkesp`-style) with clean success/`TerminateProcess`-on-mismatch
semantics -- not a bug, not involved.

## NEW (2026-08-28, cont'd x38): `cpu_add_logpoint` silently drops registrations past its 8-slot cap -- violates this project's own fail-loudly standard

`cpu/src/core.zig`: `lp_eip: [8]u32`/`lp_cb: [8]?LogpointFn`, fixed-size
arrays in the FFI-shared `CpuState` struct (same pattern as the breakpoint
table, `bp_table: [8]u32` -- not derived from any real hardware limit,
just a round number picked when this was built). `kernel.zig`'s
`cpu_add_logpoint` loops the 8 slots looking for an empty one and just
`return`s with no signal at all if none is free -- the new registration is
silently discarded, and the caller has no way to know. Bit this
investigation live 2026-08-28: 9-10 active logpoints (several stale, from
already-resolved earlier investigations) meant two newly-added probes
never fired, producing a real false lead (see the DAO/Jet entry above)
before the cap was noticed and probes were pruned. Not yet fixed --
`cpu_add_logpoint` should return a bool (or otherwise signal) on failure,
and the Python `add_logpoint` wrapper (`cpu_zig.py`) should raise/log
loudly when registration fails, matching this project's own "fail loudly
or not at all" standard. Deferred by Molly ("stay on the trace, come back
to it after") -- pick this up next.

## NEW (2026-08-28): `WaitForMultipleObjects(Ex)`'s `bAlertable` param is a no-op -- fine today, must be wired in if APCs ever get modeled

`_wait_for_multiple_common` (`kernel32_io.py`) reads `WaitForMultipleObjectsEx`'s
trailing `bAlertable` arg but never uses it -- a wait can never be interrupted
early by a pending APC. Verified this is currently harmless, not just
unimplemented: `QueueUserAPC`, `ReadFileEx`, and `WriteFileEx` (the only three
real Win32 APIs that can ever queue an APC to a thread) are not implemented
anywhere in `tew/api/*.py` -- with no APC source, there is no pending-APC
state `bAlertable` could ever act on. If any of those three are implemented
later, `bAlertable` (and the plain, non-Ex `SleepEx`'s alertable semantics --
same gap, same cause) need to be wired in at the same time, or an alertable
wait/sleep will silently never wake early for a queued APC.

## NEW (2026-08-26): `THREAD_SENTINEL` collision between `_call_guest_void` (static initializers) and real thread completion -- currently harmless, likely to bite later

`_call_guest_void` (`msvcrt_handlers.py:272`, used by `_initterm` to invoke a
DLL's C++ static initializers) pushes `THREAD_SENTINEL` (`0x001FE000`) as its
own inner-call return address and steps until it returns there. But
`THREAD_SENTINEL` has a real `INT 0xFE` trampoline permanently wired to
`_make_thread_return_handler` (`crt_handlers.py`) -- the same handler used
for a real spawned thread's natural completion, which calls
`scheduler.mark_current_dead()` unconditionally, with no way to tell "an
initializer just returned" apart from "this thread just died".

`_call_guest_void`'s own docstring documents the precondition this
violates: "this helper is only called from main-thread context ... so
hitting the sentinel does not corrupt cooperative-thread bookkeeping." That
was true until 2026-08-26's DllMain-for-static-imports fix (see changelog
x34/x35): `oleaut32.dll`'s real `DllMain` has a genuine `_initterm` static
initializer, and calling it now happens *nested inside* an in-flight
`_invoke_emulated_proc` call (tracking `OLEAUT32.dll`'s own `DllMain` as
`started_thread_idx`). The initializer returning to `THREAD_SENTINEL`
spuriously marks that thread dead mid-call
(`/tmp/emu.log`: "Thread 1000 returned normally" immediately followed by
"[_invoke_emulated_proc] thread idx=0 ... has died"). This run happened to
still produce the correct result (`_invoke_emulated_proc`'s
`genuinely_completed` check apparently still passed despite the spurious
death flag) -- not verified whether that holds in general, or just got
lucky this once.

Not yet fixed -- flagging so it doesn't get rediscovered from scratch next
time a DLL's `DllMain` (real or via `_ensure_dll_ready`) has static
initializers AND is invoked through `_invoke_emulated_proc`'s nested-call
path. Fix would need `_call_guest_void` to use its own dedicated
sentinel/return address (like `_invoke_emulated_proc`'s own
`_get_dialog_sentinel`-allocated one) instead of sharing `THREAD_SENTINEL`
with real thread completion.

## RESOLVED (2026-08-26): 101 `test_oleaut32_*.py` unit tests and dead `oleaut32_handlers.py` cleaned up

Deleted the 7 obsolete `tests/unit/api/test_oleaut32_*.py` unit test files that tested Python stubs now handled by real `oleaut32.dll`. Removed all dead Python `oleaut32.dll` stubs and trap objects (~1,100 lines), removed the temporary `_NoOleaut32Stubs` shim, migrated active `ole32.dll` COM handlers to `tew/api/ole32_handlers.py` (`register_ole32_handlers`), and updated callers in `crt_handlers.py` and `test_ole32_com.py`.

## RESOLVED (2026-08-26): statically-imported DLLs' `DllMain` now runs; original DAO license-key BSTR bug confirmed fixed

Fixed `build_iat_map`/`run_exe.py` so `d3d8.dll`/`oleaut32.dll`/`rpcrt4.dll`/
`secur32.dll` (MCity_d.exe's own direct imports) actually run their real
`DllMain(DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH)` now, matching real Windows loader ordering.
Working through the resulting wave of newly-exercised missing handlers
(GetSystemTimeAsFileTime, LoadLibraryExW, InitializeSListHead, CreateEventW,
several ntdll.dll Rtl* primitives, wsprintfA, RegisterClipboardFormatA,
GetSystemDirectoryA, CoSetState) confirmed the original bug fixed
end-to-end: `SysAllocString` now returns a real BSTR, and the game runs
real single-race gameplay DB traffic instead of halting on
`Database initialization failed!`. Full writeup: status.md "cont'd x35",
status_archive.md "cont'd x34" for the root-cause trace.

## RESOLVED (2026-08-26): `kernel32.dll!SearchPathA` and `SearchPathW` implemented

Implemented standard Win32 file search sequence and custom path search for `SearchPathA` and `SearchPathW` (`kernel32_io.py`). Live run confirmed `SearchPathW("expsrv.dll")` resolves cleanly to `C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM32\expsrv.dll`.

New blocker opened immediately downstream: `msvcrt.dll!wcsncpy`, called by `OLEAUT32.dll` at ~61.3s to copy the found typelib/DLL path.

## OBSOLETE (2026-08-26): real `.tlb` type-library parsing for `LoadTypeLibEx`

**Superseded, do not pick this up** -- the entire premise was wrong. `LoadTypeLibEx`
never actually needed a hand-built parser: `oleaut32.dll` genuinely loads as
real code in this emulator, but was being unconditionally shadowed by
`oleaut32_handlers.py`'s own registered Python handlers (`dll_loader.py`'s
`patch_iat_entry` tries a registered handler before ever checking a real
DLL's export). Fixed 2026-08-26 by dropping every `"oleaut32.dll"`
registration that file makes -- real `oleaut32.dll` now parses `expsrv.dll`'s
real, embedded `TYPELIB` PE resource itself and answers `Bind`/`GetDllEntry`/
`GetFuncDesc` correctly and automatically. See changelog.md 2026-08-26.

**Follow-up cleanup (RESOLVED 2026-08-26)**: dead `oleaut32_handlers.py` code removed and active `ole32.dll` handlers moved to `ole32_handlers.py`.

## RESOLVED (2026-08-27/28, cont'd x36/x37): "Database initialization failed!" cleared -- DB init now runs for real

Was caused by the chain of missing handlers fixed across x36/x37 (`_llseek`/`_lread`,
`LoadLibraryA` stub-DLL fallback, `RegNotifyChangeKeyValue`, `WaitForMultipleObjects`,
`GetStringTypeExW`, `wcsncmp`, etc.) -- DB init itself now completes and the game reaches
real query execution. New, deeper blocker opened immediately downstream: see the
`StockAssembly_SelectAPT` DAO/Jet query-parameter entry above.
