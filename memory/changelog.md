## 2026-04-11 — v0.7.0 — Code hygiene session

**No step count change** — 10,765 steps, same GetStringTypeW halt.

**Structural fixes:**
- `SavedCPUState` moved from `tew/api/_state.py` to `tew/hardware/cpu.py`
  (it's a CPU type; hardware layer shouldn't depend on api layer)
- `save_state()` / `restore_state()` added as methods on `CPU`
  (they touch CPU internals directly; belong on the class)
- Duplicate `_save_cpu_state` / `_restore_cpu_state` functions removed from
  `kernel32_handlers.py` and `kernel32_io.py` — was an exact copy-paste

**Linter / tooling:**
- `ruff` installed and configured in `pyproject.toml`
- `requires-python` bumped to `>=3.12` (venv runs 3.13; fixes f-string
  backslash escape syntax errors that were latent on 3.11)
- 48 unused imports removed (auto-fix)
- `_vt` in `oleaut32_handlers.py` prefixed with `_` to signal intentional discard
- E701/E702 (compact one-liners in opcode tables) suppressed globally —
  intentional style for condition code dispatch and paired flag sets

**Removed:**
- `main.py` — predated the port, `run_exe.py` is the entry point

**Deferred (documented in memory):**
- Split `_state.py` into DTOs vs runtime state
- Split large handler files by concept (heap, file, thread, sync)
  rather than by DLL name
